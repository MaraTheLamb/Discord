"""
Loads bot configuration from YAML files.
By default, this simply loads the default
configuration located at `config-default.yml`.
If a file called `config.yml` is found in the
project directory, the default configuration
is recursively updated with any settings from
the custom configuration. Any settings left
out in the custom user configuration will stay
their default values from `config-default.yml`.
